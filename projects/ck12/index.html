						<h1><strong>Designer (Contractor)<br/>Ck-12 Foundation</strong><br/>
						Sept 2011 - Aug 2016</h1>
						<p>Palo Alto, CA</p>
						<h4>I began working at the <a href="https://www.ck12.org" target="blank">Ck-12 Foundation</a> as a design intern after highschool, then continued there as a deisgner and illustrator when their in-house designer left.<br/>I began developing website and app prototypes for the executive team, then started illustrating their textbooks, especially those in science and math.<br/>With one other design intern, I created the concept and template for a new "Study Guide" product they wanted to offer.</h4>
						<h4>Later they introduced a new tool for science teachers to build their own interactive science questions ("PLIXes"), and a library of pre-built questions.<br/>I helped to populate their new library, and in the process helped to refine and debug these tools,<br/>and investigate what functions were necessary, were missing, or weren't needed.</h4>
