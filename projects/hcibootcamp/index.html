						<h1><strong>MeetHalfway</strong><br/>
						Fall, 2019</h1>
						<p>Paris, FR</p>
						<h4>In a team of 4, we developed a prototype of a mobile map application called MeetHalfway to facilitate meetups.
							<br/>
							Over the course of two weeks, we conducted interviews about map use, develoed a concetp, and built and evaluated several prototypes.<br/>
							<br/>
							We first interviewed a variety of map users to collect interaction points with existing map applications.
							We conducted breakdown analyses on the interviews  and interaction points to find promising areas for design solutions.
							We also performed several group introspection activities to explore how we used various map applications ourselves.
							We did a first round of classical brainstorming, followed by video brainstorming to really dig into the interaction possibilities. 
							<br/>
							We developed personas, a use scenario, explored the design space and dimensions, and built an initial video prototype after three days to conduct a  walkthrough analysis.
							Using this walkthrough we did a redesign over the next 24 hours, and presented our final work<br/>to a panel of researchers and professors at Universit√© Paris-Saclay.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Here are example videos: <a href="video_brainstorm.mp4">video brainstorming</a>, and the <a href="video_prototype.mov">video prototype</a>.
