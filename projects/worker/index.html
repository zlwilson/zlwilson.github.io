						Winter, 2019</h1>
						<p>Enschede, NL</p>
						<h4>As a team of 5, we investigated the training methods of paramedic personel, and made a prototype virtual reality environment for collaborative training excercises.<br/>We began with interviews with a wide range of medical personel: nurses, CPR instructors, professional EMTs, firefighters, policemen, and individuals who had simply taken first aid courses in the past.<br/>We iterated through various ideas about how a VR training could be used in the mediacl training sector. Eventually we developed an idea centered around offering a collaborative training system for professionals (police, fire and medical), to allow them to train in VR for emergencies when teamwork is required.<br/>We developed this prototype in the form of a storyboard which we tested with EMTs in Estonia, and the local fire department in Enschede, NL.</h4>
