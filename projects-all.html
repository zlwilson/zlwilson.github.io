          <p style="margin-top: 3px">
            I am currently conducting user-centered design research into creating technologies that support embodied creativity.
            This work explores the fundamentals of the creative process, the value of movement for focus and creativity, and how serendipity can become a design goal.
            I have been working with creative professionals to fundamentally understand their creative processes, and to test the design artifacts I have generated.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began by collecting user stories from musicians, audio engineers, visual artists, illustrators, graphic designers and architects.
            I analyzed and synthesized these stories into three key themes of the creative process of professionals: the signature toolbox, the mindfuck mindset, and manufactured obstacles.
            Based on these I led several brainstorming and ideation sessions with colleagues in the Paris lab.
            These led to a video prototype to test these ideas in situated interactions, and a design space for embodied creativity support tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guided by the dimensions of this space, I designed and fabricated three technology probes to explore the space.
            The DreamEasel, FidgiPen, and AirSampler were given to a write, an illustrator and a music producer respectively.
            Through collaborative use and redesign of the probes, I generated a refined deisgn space, and process for designing Creativity Support Tools for embodied creativity.
            This is currently under review for submission to CHI 2020.

          <h2><tag class="fakelink">MeetHalfway</tag> - Université Paris-Saclay - 2019</h2>
          <p style="margin-top: 3px">
            In a team of four designers, we developed a prototype mobile, map application to facilitate meetups.
            We developed the concept and designs over the course of a week-long intensive design bootcamp at the Université Paris-Saclay.
          </p>
          <p>
            The process began with gathering interviews from a variety of users of maps, which were condensed into a set of breakdowns, from which we began to generate design ideas and features.
            Based on this interview data, we brainstormed a variety of initial concepts (<a href="projects/hcibootcamp/video_brainstorm.mp4">video brainstorm</a>), which we prototyped at various fidelities, tested with users, then iterated on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The product of this work was a set of findings, design guidelines, and several novel interactions for map applciations, which we demonstrated in a <a href="projects/hcibootcamp/video_prototype.mov">video prototype</a>, which we analyzed through a breakdown analysis.
            We presented our work to the other teams participating in the design bootcamp, as well as some visiting designers and professors.

          <h2><tag class="fakelink">Digital Safety/Training Info-Hub</tag> - Visual Art Department (UBC) - 2018</h2>
          <p style="margin-top: 3px">
            For a year and I half I worked as the designer for the Visual Art Department at UBC.
            In my last six months I was asked to migrate their training and safety information online, so I took this opportunity to take a user-centered approach and redesign the entire website, as well as how this information connected with the physical facilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began by talking to all the stakeholders involved: from students, to instructors, to facility technicians, and finally administrators.
            From there, I began to lay out a conceptual design of their website that could satisfy these diverse user requirements.
            Based on these requirements, I generated several early prototypes, starting with paper, and moving to simplified websites, which I could present and discussed with different user groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            This new website introduced new considerations about connecting digital safety information with specific physical locations.
            To link these two, I introduced QR codes and new design guides (and templates) for using QR code stickers to put information exactly where it was needed.
            They have since expanded their use of QR codes, not least for COVID-19 occupany restrictions.

<h2>Coursework</h2>
<p>I completed a dual Master of Science degree at the University of Twente and the University of Paris-Sud, through the European Institure of Innovation and Technology Digital Masters School. My focus was in human-computer interaction design, with a minor in innovation and entrepreneurship. The courses concentrated on user-centered design practices, user-experience design, user research, techniques for rapid prototyping, and capturing and designing from user insights.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 25px">My undergraduate studies in computer science focused on human-computer interaction and user-centered design methods, and software engineering (web applications, database design and algorithms).                
In visual art, my work focused on the study of humans and technology: the technohuman, the “non-spaces” created by technology, and the way that interactions with technology facilitate humanity.</p>

<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Collaboratively designed and ran a study that explored how people use different social media and messaging platforms to organize community events. Concluded the study with a set of design guidelines to support local community organizing, and a medium fidelity prototype implementing them. <a href="projects/design/index.html">more</a></p>

    <p>Collaboratively designed and ran a study into home-delivery grocery systems, with a focus on integrating them into workflow in the kitchen (e.g. smart kitchens, meal planning, etc.) <a href="projects/design/index.html">more</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Built from scratch the backend of a RESTful API to search, and sort all the enrollment data at University of British Columbia. Then, built a Javascript front-end using the latest libraries (React) to display the data and allow users to explore it in a web-UI environment.
