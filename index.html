                <p>I'm currently pursuing a Masters of Science in Human-Computer Interaction Design at the University of Twente in the Netherlands.</p>
				<p>For my Bachelor’s degree I began studying computer science.</p>
				<p>I’ve always enjoyed mathematics and building things, so I fit right in there.</p>
				<p>Soon after starting however I discovered the art program at my university. I began with a couple simple courses, but then I met a professor whose practice centered on how humanity was changing, or had changed through its relationship and interactions with technology.</p>
				<p>This quickly became the focus of my undergraduate degree, though practical fine art as well as studies in the history of art and technology.</p>
				<p>I always kept up my computer science education however as it seemed crucial to be able to practice and understand computers from the inside out, even as I studied it from the outside in.</p>
				<p>All this is to say that my Bachelor’s degree evolved into a five year research study into the relationship between humans and computers, both from the development of applications and research in a multi-modal user interaction lab, as well as through studies in history and my own artistic practice.</p>
