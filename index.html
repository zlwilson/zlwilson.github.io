                <p>I'm currently pursuing a Masters of Science in Human-Computer Interaction Design at Université Paris-Sud, through the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.</p>
				<p>I began my Bachelor’s degree studying computer science. I’ve always enjoyed mathematics and building things, so I fit right in there.</p>
				<p>Soon after starting however I was drawn towards the visual arts. I met a professor whose practice centered on how humanity was changing, or had changed, through its relationship and interactions with technology. This quickly became the focus of my undergraduate degree, both though my fine art practice, as well as continiued studies into computer science.</p>
				<p>By the end of my studies I had found the field of Human-Computer Interaction and I was focusing on user research and user-centered design methods in my explorations of human-computer relationships.</p>
				<p>Now, I refer to myself as a human-computer interaction researcher, and pursue both these interests: I continue to explore how technology and humans affect one another, and I build and design novel technologies focussed on real human needs.</p>
