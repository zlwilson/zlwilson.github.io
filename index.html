			<p>
				My name is Zack Wilson, a UX designer and researcher, with a background in design, fine art, and computer science.
				My interests lie in the intersection of design, technology, and human behavior, and my design work, research, and art aims to explore these complex relationships.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have worked in a variety of design roles, beginning in graphic and visual design, and gradually shifting to interaction and experience design with my passion and empathy for human- and user-oriented design.<br>
				I have also worked in human-computer interaction labs in France and Canada, and exhibited artwork in Vancouver, the Netherlands, and Paris.
			</p>
			<p>
				My education echoed my passions, beginning with studies in computer science, and evolving to encompass fine art and design, concluding with a Masters of Science in Human-Computer Interaction Design at the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am currently working in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at INRIA Paris, exploring the design process of embodied Creativity Support Tools.<br>
				This work pulls together psychology and neuroscience literature on creativity and embodiment, then uses a human-centered design approach to prototype and test technologies to support professionals' creative processes.<br>
