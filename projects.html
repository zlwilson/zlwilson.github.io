                    #interaction-design #user-research #analysis #user-centered-design #data-collection
                    <p style="margin-top: 3px">I am currently conducting research into creativity support tools. I have been collecting stories to build user-centered designs for different creative professionals: musicians, audio engineers, visual artists, illustrators, graphic designers and architects. I have been analyzing and combinging these stories into an summary of the different stages, keys, techniques, and vaguaries of the creative process. I have designed three embodied creativity tools, that support musicians, writers, and illustrators across their creative processes - from ideation, to inspiration, to procrastination, to production.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 3px">In collaboration between Samsung R&D Vancouver and the eDAPT Lab at the University of British Columbia, I led a research project to redesign a kiosk to help seniors learn to use smart phones. With one other research assistant, we updated an old version of the application, conducted initial user testing, iterated on the design of the experience, then conducted a formal usability study, using thematic analysis to process the interviews, which was presented as a poster at the ASSETS '18 conference.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 3px">Started as an intern, then designer, then contractor, I mocked up website and app prototypes for the executive team. I helped develop the concept and design of a new line of “Study Guides”, and created hundreds of illustrations for science and math textbooks. I also helped to debug, test and refine beta content tools for teachers to develop their own interactive problem sets.</p>

                <h2>Coursework</h2>
                <p>I completed a dual Master of Science degree at the University of Twente and the University of Paris-Sud, through the European Institure of Innovation and Technology Digital Masters School. My focus was in human-computer interaction design, with a minor in innovation and entrepreneurship. The courses concentrated on user-centered design practices, user-experience design, user research, techniques for rapid prototyping, and capturing and designing from user insights.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 25px">My undergraduate studies in computer science focused on human-computer interaction and user-centered design methods, and software engineering (web applications, database design and algorithms).                
                In visual art, my work focused on the study of humans and technology: the technohuman, the “non-spaces” created by technology, and the way that interactions with technology facilitate humanity.</p>
